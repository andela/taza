    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>We are recruiting experienced software professionals (of all types, not just programmers) to volunteer as mentors for our young superstars. We want them to each have at least a few external role models, who can provide unbiased career advise, second opinions on issues that may crop up, congratulations when deserved, and a virtual shoulder to cry on when times are bad. Fellows are expected to devote at least 30-60 minutes per week communicating with each of their mentors.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Andela takes this program very seriously. Our volunteer mentors are screened for industry experience, as well as compatibility with our values and social mission.<br/></p>
        <p>Want to apply as a mentor? Sign in now with your Google Account to get the ball rolling. If accepted, you’ll claim an important role in the biggest technology revolution ever launched in Africa, if not the world.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">Andela only recruits young talent that scores at the highest percentiles of problem solving aptitude, intellectual/experiential disposition and other personality factors. We then verify their worthiness for the Andela 4-year fellowship via an elite five month training regimen that leaves them prepared to tackle web and mobile software development using the latest open-source and agile techniques.</p>
    <p class="text-muted">During training, every element of professional development is also covered, from typing speed to verbal and spoken business English. Once they are ready to work with our partners, Andela developers are place as full-time, remote staff members for great companies around the globe.   </p>
